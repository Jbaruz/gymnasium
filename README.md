# TF Agents Lunar Lander Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow Agents (TF-Agents) to train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to land a lunar lander in the OpenAI Gym environment. The main steps involved in the project are:

1. **Installing Necessary Packages**:
   We install various packages including `gymnasium[box2d]`, `tf-agents[reverb]`, `pyvirtualdisplay`, and `xvfb` to set up the environment and dependencies.

2. **Setting Up the Virtual Display**:
   To render the Lunar Lander environment in a headless environment like Google Colab, we use `pyvirtualdisplay`.

3. **Verifying the Lunar Lander Environment**:
   We create and render the Lunar Lander environment using Gymnasium to ensure it is set up correctly.

4. **Initializing the DQN Agent**:
   We set up the TF-Agents environment, define the Q-Network architecture, and configure the DQN agent with necessary parameters such as the optimizer, epsilon-greedy policy, and discount factor.

5. **Setting Up the Replay Buffer, Dataset, and Driver**:
   The replay buffer stores experiences collected by the agent, the dataset samples batches of experiences from the replay buffer for training, and the driver collects experiences from the environment.

6. **Collecting Initial Data**:
   We collect initial experiences using a random policy to fill the replay buffer before training the agent.

7. **Training the Agent**:
   We define a training loop to train the agent over a specified number of iterations, where the agent interacts with the environment, collects experiences, and updates its Q-Network based on sampled experiences.

8. **Creating a Video of the Trained Policy**:
   After training, we create a video to visualize the performance of the trained agent in the Lunar Lander environment.

## Importance of the Project

### Educational Value
This project provides a comprehensive workflow for training a DQN agent using TF-Agents and demonstrates how to set up and manage the necessary components such as the environment, replay buffer, dataset, and driver. It serves as an educational tool for anyone looking to understand reinforcement learning concepts and the practical implementation of a DQN agent.

### Reinforcement Learning Application
The Lunar Lander environment is a classic reinforcement learning problem that involves continuous state and discrete action spaces. Successfully training an agent to land the lunar module demonstrates the applicability of reinforcement learning techniques to complex control problems.
